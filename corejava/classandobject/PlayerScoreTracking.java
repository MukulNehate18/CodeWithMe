//2. Player Score Tracking
//Task: Create a Player class with fields playerName, matchesPlayed, and score. Implement a constructor for initialization.
// In another class Game, create an array of Player objects and write a method to find the player with the highest score.
//Explanation: The Player class holds the playerâ€™s data, and Game performs the logic to find the top scorer.
